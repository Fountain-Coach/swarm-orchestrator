# Swarm Orchestrator

The **Swarm Orchestrator** is a lightweight control service designed to manage and deploy container-based services within a Docker Swarm setup. It serves as the execution backend in the [FountainAI](https://github.com/Fountain-Coach) ecosystem, dynamically interpreting YAML-based deployment definitions and translating them into real-time, actionable service updates.

This orchestrator provides developers with a clean HTTP API to:
- Deploy, inspect, and remove container services.
- Synchronize the running stack with a versioned `fountainai-stack.yml` file.
- Roll out or roll back updates with intent-aware safety.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fountain-Coach/swarm-orchestrator.git
   cd swarm-orchestrator
   ```

2. **Edit the stack definition**:
   Customize `fountainai-stack.yml` to define your services declaratively.

3. **Start the orchestrator** (locally or via container):
   ```bash
   docker build -t swarm-orchestrator .
   docker run -p 8000:8000 --name swarm swarm-orchestrator
   ```

4. **Ping the health endpoint**:
   ```
   curl http://localhost:8000/v1/health
   ```
